# Thesis Translation Using LLMs (Romanian to English)

Overview

This project demonstrates the process of translating a bachelor thesis written in Romanian into English using Large Language Models (LLMs). It includes the extraction of text from a Romanian PDF document, translation using NLP, and the final generation of an English thesis. The project is designed to showcase how LLMs can be utilized for language translation tasks, making academic documents accessible to a wider audience.

# The repository includes:

The original thesis in Romanian.
The translated thesis in English.
Python scripts for text preprocessing, translation, and evaluation.
A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the entire workflow.

# Motivation

I created this project as part of my academic work to provide English access to my bachelor thesis, which was originally written in Romanian. By utilizing an LLM, this project showcases the practical application of NLP (Natural Language Processing) models in the context of academic document translation. This can be useful for those looking to automate translations, build custom translation pipelines, or better understand the potential of LLMs in real-world applications.

# Key Features:
Text Extraction: Extracts the content from a PDF thesis (in Romanian).
Translation: Uses a pre-trained LLM model to translate the thesis from Romanian to English.
Post-processing: Cleans and formats the translated text for readability and accuracy.
Evaluation: Evaluation of translation quality through metrics and manual review.
